First step:
- summing empty string returns 0 | "" -> "0"
- summing string with number returns that number | "5" -> "5.0"
- summing string with two numbers returns their sum | "1,2" -> "3.0"
- summing string with two numbers returns their sum with 1 decimal digit| "1.1,2.2" -> "3.3"



Many numbers
- string with 4 numbers return their sum | "1,2,3" -> "6.0"
- string with non-number returns error | "1,x,2" -> error
