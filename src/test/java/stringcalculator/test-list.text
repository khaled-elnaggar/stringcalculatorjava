First step
- empty string returns 0, | "" -> "0.0"
- string with one number returns the same number | "5" -> "5.0"
- string with 2 numbers returns their sum | "1,2" -> "3.5"
- string with 2 numbers have decimal places returns their sum (up to 1 decimal digit truncated) | "1.5,1.9" -> "3.4"

  (will be moved to next user story due to lengthy test list)
- string with more than 2 numbers returns an error
- string a character, returns an error
